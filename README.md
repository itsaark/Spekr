Spekr is designed to help you share content publicly within your locality (100-mile radius) and eventually all around the world.

When you post something on Spekr, it is public by default.

You can only have one post at any point in time, i.e when you create a new post, your old post will be deleted.

World Feed contains top posts from around the world in the last 24hrs.
